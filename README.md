# My bash scripts:
- yt.sh: For downloading mp3 audio from youtube videos
- (the rest are self explanatory)

## Instructions
- Read the script you find useful:
  - You might learn a thing or two,
  - And running arbitrary scripts/commands on your system is 
    called a "_cybersecurity threat_", the scripts are less
    than 40 lines each, it'll take you a minute to see if 
    something is safe to run.

- Read the README section at top of the script:
  - It'll outline if you need any utilities.

- Change the variables:
  - Especially needed for the backup scripts; you might want 
    to backup different folders and output them at a different
    location, customize the script as you see fit.

- Make the script executable:
  - `sudo chmod +x example.sh`

- Run the executable:
  - `./example.sh`
